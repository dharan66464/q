It's also free to use on Scala Hosting's managed VPS plans.

### Security Features:
Scala Hosting prioritizes security. They offer free SSL certificates, daily backups, and a custom-built security solution called SShield. SShield is an AI-powered system that monitors your website for malware and other threats in real-time, automatically blocking suspicious activity. This proactive approach helps keep your artisan website safe from cyberattacks.

### Customer Support:
Scala Hosting is known for its responsive and knowledgeable customer support team. They offer 24/7 support via live chat, email, and phone. Their support agents are well-trained and can help you with a wide range of issues, from website setup to troubleshooting technical problems.
